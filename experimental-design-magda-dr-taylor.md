  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10922).

- Experiment: curation of an environment in which only one variable changes.

- Correlation vs. causation.
  An experiment can attribute cause, whereas an observational study cannot.
  Observational study: observing a process and trying to find correlations.

- Hidden costs of ideas: the opportunity cost of your time.

- Experimental plan guidelines

        - Lightweight 1-page document defining research problem, e.g.,
          comparing the generalization of learning algorithm A to that of
          learning algorithm B.

        - Choose response variable (e.g., FLOPS).

        - Choose factors and levels (e.g., which learning algorithm).

                - Bayesian optimization.

                - Grid search.

        - Experimental design.

                - Resampling, testing training, validation.

        - Performing experiment.

                - Scaling back number of epochs, for debugging.

        - Statistical analysis.

        - Conclusions

                - Think ahead
