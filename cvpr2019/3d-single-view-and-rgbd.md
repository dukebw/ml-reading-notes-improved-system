# 3D Single View and RGB-D

## TextureNet: consistent local parametrizations for learning from high-resolution signals on meshes

- GCNN (Masci), Tangent convolution (Tatarchenko), Atlasnet (Groueix).

- 4-way rotationally symmetric field


## PlaneRCNN: 3D plane reconstruction

- Aggregate global information from planar segmentation masks.

- Warping loss.


## Learning 3d reconstruction in function space

- Represent mesh as a continuous decision boundary of deep learning classifier.

- Marching cubes.

- Latent space interpolations.


## 3D shape reconstruction from images in the frequency domain


## Silhouette-based clothing reconstruction

- Bodynet


## Convolutional mesh regression for single-image human body regression

- Keypoint -> body mesh fitting is slow and fails when keypoints are wrong.

- Regression-based reconstruction

- Committing to a specific parametric model is constraining.

- Rethinking:

        - Target representation: direct vertex regression instead of parameter regression.

        - Network architecture:


## H+O unified egocentric

- RGB only, hand pose, object pose -> action recognition.


## Learning depth for moving people by watching frozen people
