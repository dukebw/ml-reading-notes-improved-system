# Face and body

## Face model learning from videos

- Backprop through blendshape models?


## 3D hand pose and shape estimation from a single RGB image


## 3D hand shape and pose from images in the wild


## Weakly-supervised 3D human pose geometry representation

- Novel view synthesis


## Slim DensePose

- If you are going to annotate data, annotate large datasets, even if sparsely,
  and annotate video instead of images.


## Combining 3D morphable models: a large scale face-and-head model


## Unsupervised object-based disentangling of object shape and appearance

- !!!


## Total body capture from monocular videos

- Skeleton in heatmap representation

- Embed part orientation field (POF) in heatmaps

- OpenPose


## Expressive body capture: 3d hands, face and body from a single image
