## Kervolutional Neural Networks

- Related work: Non-linear convolution (Zoumpourlis), quadratic convolution,
  kernel pooling (Cui).

- Kernel trick to nonlinearize inner product of convolution.

- Relationship with KCF?

- Kernel cross-correlator (KCC)


## Why ReLU networks yield high-confidence predictions far away from the training data


## Neural Rejuvenation: Improving Deep Network Training by...

- Optimizer monitors utilization ratio of parameters, and re-initializes them
  if they drop below a threshold.

- Use BN gamma parameter as ``liveliness'' of neurons.


## Auto Deeplab

- Challenges: existing methods search only within cells, not the outer structure.
  Also, computation?

- Differentiable NAS: DARTS.
