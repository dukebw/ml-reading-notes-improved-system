# Egocentric Perception

## Anticipation and prediction for scene understanding

- Motivation:

        - Long-term prediction

        - Uncertainty

        - Multi-modality of possible futures.

- Time-conditioned action anticipation in one shot.

- Long-term image boundary extrapolation.

- Long-term on-board prediction of pedestrians in traffic scenes.

- Accurate and diverse sampling of sequences based on a ``best of many'' sample
  objective.

        - When sampling a generative model of futures, idea is to update only
          the sample that is closest to the ground truth, and not to update
          _all_ samples (and thus pushing all samples towards the average).
