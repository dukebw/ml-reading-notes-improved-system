# Segmentation and Grouping


## Improving semantic segmentation via video propagation and label relaxation

- Label propagation in video sequences (CVPR 2010)

- SDCNet

- Predict five previous and futrue frames.

- De-emphasize learning of order pixels from augmented data (-> robustness to
  label noise).

- Utilize unlabeled frames to improve semantic segmentation performance.


## Accel: a corrective fusion network for efficient semantic segmentation from video

- Two branches: flow-based warping, and per-frame correction.


## Collaborative global-local networks


## Generative model for video object segmentation
