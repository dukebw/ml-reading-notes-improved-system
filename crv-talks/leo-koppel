Manifold geometry with fast automatic derivatives and coordinate frame
semantics checking in C++


- Geometric expressions in code, and derivatives of those expressions on a
  manifold (SO(3), SE(3))

        - Catch bugs at compile time with automatic differentiation

- Coordinate frame semantics checking

- Want: position in body frame, from camera frame.

- Coordinate frame semantics: check subscripts of transformation with frame in
  code

        - Caller of function has to conform to the semantics of the return
          value, without adhering to comments or something.

- Supports operations on manifolds

        - automatic differentation: Fast, compared to hand-optimized
          derivatives?

        - Manifold geometry: derivatives w.r.t. each SO(3) or SE(3) element,
          instead of w.r.t. each matrix element.

        - Use expression templates at compile time.

        - Add unique types to everything in an expression (e.g., via frame
          semantics)

        - Block automatic differentiation
