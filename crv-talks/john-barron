Leaf (as in tree leaf) Occlusion

- Fit a beta-spline S to model a leaf contour point set C

- Discrete contour evolution to find points of high convexity

- Subgraph matching

Frechet distance metric

        - Maximum distance between two overlaid curves

Energy minimization

        - ?

Curvature and shape context descriptor energy terms

        - Local/global/shape context descriptors

        - StringCut features

GNCCP optimization

        - Used to minimize the energy function

Data: Swedish leaf dataset, Flavia and Leafsnap dataset
