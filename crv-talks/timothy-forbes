Deep autoencoders with residual connections for urban reconstruction

- SegNet + ResNeXt

- ISPRS satellite imagery dataset

- Cluster depth maps (predicted by SegNeXt) for reconstruction

        - Nearest-neibhour interpolation

        - Voronoi diagram computed for each cluster to get tree trunks

        - PCA to determine average ratio between eigenvalues for the clusters.
          Used to count how many cars are in a line (e.g., a two-car-length
          line of car segmentation).

        - Inverse solid geometry for reconstruction.
