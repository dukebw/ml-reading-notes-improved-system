# Writing Skills


## Writing

- Schedule a long block of time (how long?)

- If you have writer's block: schedule short sessions, write something, then
  walk away.

- Make quick/rough notes the moment you come across an idea (where, directly in
  the paper draft?).

- Google Keep -> Google docs -> LaTeX


## Revising

- Step away from your writing for a period of time, then come back and
  critically evaluate.

- Read out loud

- Read paragraphs (should be self-contained) out loud to family members.
  The subsequent explanation can replace the original paragraph.

- Sentence compression.

- Revise with pen and paper.

- "Kill your darlings"

- Notation and terminology consistency check.


## Editing

- "Avoid hostages to fortune" (Zach Lipton)

- Editing vs. proofreading

- Organization, transitions, evidence = arguments
