        title = {Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks},
        abstract = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the
                    prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input
                    data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic
                    signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units.
                    Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence
                    learners that would seem well suited to such tasks.
                    However, because they require pre-segmented training
                    data, and post-processing to transform their outputs
                    into label sequences, their applicability has so far
                    been limited. This paper presents a novel method for
                    training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly,
                    thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT
                    speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a
                    baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN. 1.},

                Learning to store information over extended time intervals by
                recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time,
                mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We
                briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this
                problem, then address it by introducing a novel,
                efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory
                (LSTM).  Truncating the gradient where this does not do
                harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in
                excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing
                constant error flow through constant error carousels
                within special units.  Multiplicative gate units learn
                to open and close access to the constant error flow.
                LSTM is local in space and time; its computational
                complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our
                experiments with artificial data involve local,
                distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In
                comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back
                propagation through time, recurrent cascade
                correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking,
                LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much
                faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial
                long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by
                previous recurrent network algorithms.
