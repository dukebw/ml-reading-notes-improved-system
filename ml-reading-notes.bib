        title = {Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks},
        abstract = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the
                    prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input
                    data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic
                    signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units.
                    Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence
                    learners that would seem well suited to such tasks.
                    However, because they require pre-segmented training
                    data, and post-processing to transform their outputs
                    into label sequences, their applicability has so far
                    been limited. This paper presents a novel method for
                    training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly,
                    thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT
                    speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a
                    baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN. 1.},

                Learning to store information over extended time intervals by
                recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time,
                mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We
                briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this
                problem, then address it by introducing a novel,
                efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory
                (LSTM).  Truncating the gradient where this does not do
                harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in
                excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing
                constant error flow through constant error carousels
                within special units.  Multiplicative gate units learn

                LSTM is local in space and time; its computational
                complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our
                experiments with artificial data involve local,
                distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In
                comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back
                propagation through time, recurrent cascade
                correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking,
                LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much
                faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial
                long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by
                previous recurrent network algorithms.

                Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual
                learning framework to ease the training of networks that are
                substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly
                reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with
                reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced
                functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing
                that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can
                gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the
                ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up
                to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower
                complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57%
                error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place
                on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present
                analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.

                The depth of representations is of central importance for many
                visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep
                representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the
                COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are
                foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015
                competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of
                ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and
                COCO segmentation.

                We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via
                an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two
                models: a generative model G that captures the data
                distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the
                probability that a sample came from the training data rather
                than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the
                probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds
                to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary
                functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering
                the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere.
                In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer
                perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with
                backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or
                unrolled approximate inference networks during either training
                or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential
                of the framework through qualitative and quantitative
                evaluation of the generated samples.

              Restricted Boltzmann machines were devel- oped using binary
              stochastic hidden units.  These can be generalized by
              replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of
              copies that all have the same weights but have pro-
              gressively more negative biases. The learning and
              inference rules for these “Stepped Sig- moid Units” are
              unchanged. They can be ap- proximated efficiently by
              noisy, rectified lin- ear units. Compared with binary
              units, these units learn features that are better for
              object recognition on the NORB dataset and face
              verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.
              Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve
              information about relative in- tensities as information
              travels through mul- tiple layers of feature detectors.

                problems. These networks not only learn the mapping
                from input image to output image, but also learn a loss
                function to train this mapping. This makes it possible
                to apply the same generic approach to problems that
                traditionally would require very different loss

                effective at synthesizing photos from label maps,
                reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images,
                among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer

                of the discriminator loss. The discriminator convolves over and

                from the ground truth distribution or from the generated
                distribution. Optimal N is found to be 70px.

                We present an unsupervised visual feature learning algorithm driven by
                context-based pixel prediction. By analogy with auto-encoders,
                we propose Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network
                trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region
                conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this
                task, context encoders need to both understand the content of
                the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for
                the missing part(s).  When training context encoders, we have
                experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction
                loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The
                latter produces much sharper results because it can better
                handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context
                encoder learns a representation that captures not just
                appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We
                quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned
                features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and
                segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used

                Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of
                hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem
                is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied
                on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated
                colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces
                vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying
                uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and
                use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of
                colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass
                in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We
                evaluate our algorithm using a "colorization Turing test," asking human
                participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color
                image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32% of the trials,
                significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization
                can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning,
                acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art

                In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has
                seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively,
                unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we
                hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised
                learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called
                deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have
                certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a
                strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image
                datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional
                adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object
                parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally,
                we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability
                as general image representations.

                We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures that
                we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We
                focus on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the
                generation of images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most
                work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model
                that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model
                to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new
                techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised
                classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of
                high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates
                MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and
                CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also
                present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that

                We introduce the "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network" model (EBGAN)
                which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low
                energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to
                other regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen
                as being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies,
                while the discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated
                samples. Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use
                a wide variety of architectures and loss functionals in
                addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output.
                Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as
                using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the
                reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show
                that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than
                regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale
                architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.

                networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to

                entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the

                our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing
                approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene
                classification database to train our model, exploiting the class labels
                of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the

                Furthermore, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different
                types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a

                Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art
                performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification
                and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and
                probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level
                classification (also called "semantic image segmentation"). We show
                that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently
                localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very
                invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We
                overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining
                the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected
                Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our "DeepLab" system is
                able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is
                beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new
                state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task,
                reaching 71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be
                obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel
                application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow
                dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a
                modern GPU.

                Image-generating machine learning models are typically trained with loss
                functions based on distance in the image space. This often leads to
                over-smoothed results. We propose a class of loss functions, which we
                call deep perceptual similarity metrics (DeePSiM), that mitigate this
                problem. Instead of computing distances in the image space, we compute
                distances between image features extracted by deep neural networks.
                This metric better reflects perceptually similarity of images and thus
                leads to better results. We show three applications: autoencoder
                training, a modification of a variational autoencoder, and inversion of
                deep convolutional networks. In all cases, the generated images look

                convolutional neural networks (dCNNs) for synthesizing 2D
                images. The generative MRF acts on higher-levels of a dCNN
                feature pyramid, controling the image layout at an abstract
                level. We apply the method to both photographic and
                non-photo-realistic (artwork) synthesis tasks. The MRF
                regularizer prevents over-excitation artifacts and reduces
                implausible feature mixtures common to previous dCNN inversion
                approaches, permitting synthezing photographic content with
                increased visual plausibility. Unlike standard MRF-based
                texture synthesis, the combined system can both match and adapt
                local features with considerable variability, yielding results
                far out of reach of classic generative MRF methods.

                ground-truth labels. Our method has several interesting
                properties: (1) compared with classical machine learning
                algorithms like CRFs and Structural SVM, ConvPP automatically
                learns rich convolutional kernels to capture both short- and
                long- range contexts; (2) compared with cascade classifiers
                like Auto-Context, ConvPP avoids the iterative steps of
                learning a series of discriminative classifiers and
                automatically learns contextual configurations; (3) compared
                with recent efforts combing CNN models with CRFs and RNNs,
                ConvPP learns convolution in the labeling space with much
                improved modeling capability and less manual specification; (4)
                compared with Bayesian models like MRFs, ConvPP capitalizes on
                the rich representation power of convolution by automatically
                learning priors built on convolutional filters. We accomplish
                our task using pseudo-likelihood approximation to the prior
                under a novel fixed-point network structure that facilitates an
                end-to-end learning process. We show state-of-the-art results
                on sequential labeling and image labeling benchmarks.

                We consider image transformation problems, where an input image
                is transformed into an output image. Recent methods for such
                problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural
                networks using a \emph{per-pixel} loss between the output and
                ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality
                images can be generated by defining and optimizing
                \emph{perceptual} loss functions based on high-level features
                extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of
                both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss
                functions for training feed-forward networks for image
                transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer,
                where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the
                optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al in real-time.
                Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives
                similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude
                faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution,
                where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives
                visually pleasing results.

                Automatic synthesis of realistic images from text would be
                interesting and useful, but current AI systems are still far
                from this goal. However, in recent years generic and powerful
                recurrent neural network architectures have been developed to
                learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile,
                deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have
                begun to generate highly compelling images of specific
                categories, such as faces, album covers, and room interiors. In

                image model- ing, translating visual concepts from characters
                to pixels. We demonstrate the capability of our model to

                Current generative frameworks use end-to-end learning and
                generate images by sampling from uniform noise distribution.
                However, these approaches ignore the most basic principle of
                image formation: images are product of: (a) Structure: the
                underlying 3D model; (b) Style: the texture mapped onto
                structure. In this paper, we factorize the image generation
                process and propose Style and Structure Generative Adversarial
                Network (S^2-GAN). Our S^2-GAN has two components: the
                Structure-GAN generates a surface normal map; the Style-GAN
                takes the surface normal map as input and generates the 2D
                image. Apart from a real vs. generated loss function, we use an
                additional loss with computed surface normals from generated
                images. The two GANs are first trained independently, and then
                merged together via joint learning. We show our S^2-GAN model
                is interpretable, generates more realistic images and can be
                used to learn unsupervised RGBD representations.

                Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires
                modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while
                preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has
                considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the
                manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we
                propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data
                using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a
                class of image editing operations, and constrain their output
                to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model
                automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic
                as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of
                constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We
                evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo
                manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can
                further be used for changing one image to look like the other,
                as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on
                user's scribbles.

                Learning to predict future images from a video sequence
                involves the construction of an internal representation that
                models the image evolution accurately, and therefore, to some
                degree, its content and dynamics. This is why pixel-space video
                prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised
                feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a
                very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future
                frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision
                applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next
                frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of
                tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a
                convolutional network to generate future frames given an input
                sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions
                obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
                function, we propose three different and complementary feature
                learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial
                training method, and an image gradient difference loss
                function. We compare our predictions to different published
                results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101

                future state given two depictions of an object at different
                times, and generating future states recursively in a recurrent

                evaluations of the generated results, and also conduct a human
                evaluation to compare variations of our models.

                This paper proposes Markovian Generative Adversarial Networks
                (MGANs), a method for training generative neural networks for
                efficient texture synthesis. While deep neural network
                approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable results in
                terms of synthesis quality, they still come at considerable
                computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images).
                Our paper addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a
                numerical deconvolution in previous work, we precompute a
                feed-forward, strided convolutional network that captures the
                feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly
                generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can
                directly decode brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to
                artistic paintings. With adversarial training, we obtain
                quality comparable to recent neural texture synthesis methods.
                As no optimization is required any longer at generation time,
                our run-time performance (0.25M pixel images at 25Hz) surpasses
                previous neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin
                (at least 500 times faster). We apply this idea to texture
                synthesis, style transfer, and video stylization.

                There is large consent that successful training of deep
                networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In
                this paper, we present a network and training strategy that
                relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the
                available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture

                tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.
                Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image

                We present an autoencoder that leverages learned
                representations to better measure similarities in data space.
                By combining a variational autoencoder with a generative
                adversarial network we can use learned feature representations
                in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction
                objective. Thereby, we replace element-wise errors with
                feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution
                while offering invariance towards e.g. translation. We apply
                our method to images of faces and show that it outperforms VAEs
                with element-wise similarity measures in terms of visual
                fidelity. Moreover, we show that the method learns an embedding
                in which high-level abstract visual features (e.g. wearing
                glasses) can be modified using simple arithmetic.

                The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a
                benchmark in object category classification and
                detection on hundreds of object categories and millions
                of images. The challenge has been run annually from
                2010 to present, attracting participation from more
                than fifty institutions.

                This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and
                the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a
                result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale
                ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in
                categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of
                the current state of the field of large-scale image
                classification and object detection, and compare the
                state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy.
                We conclude with lessons learned in the five years of the
                challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.

                Given two images, we want to predict which exhibits a
                particular visual attribute more than the other — even
                when the two images are quite similar. Existing
                relative attribute methods rely on global ranking
                functions; yet rarely will the visual cues relevant to
                a comparison be constant for all data, nor will humans’
                perception of the attribute necessarily permit a global
                ordering. To address these issues, we propose a local
                learning approach for fine-grained visual comparisons.
                Given a novel pair of images, we learn a local ranking
                model on the fly, using only analogous training
                comparisons. We show how to identify these analogous
                pairs using learned metrics. With results on three
                challenging datasets — including a large newly curated
                dataset for fine-grained comparisons — our method
                outperforms stateof-the-art methods for relative
                attribute prediction.

                Humans have used sketching to depict our visual world since

                the only rendering technique readily available to all
                humans. This paper is the first large scale exploration
                of human sketches. We analyze the distribution of
                non-expert sketches of everyday objects such as
                'teapot' or 'car'. We ask humans to sketch objects of a

                distributed over 250 object categories. With this

                We live in a dynamic visual world where the appearance of
                scenes changes dramatically from hour to hour or season to
                season. In this work we study “transient scene attributes” –
                high level properties which affect scene appearance, such as
                “snow”, “autumn”, “dusk”, “fog”. We define 40 transient
                attributes and use crowdsourcing to annotate thousands of
                images from 101 webcams. We use this “transient attribute
                database” to train regressors that can predict the presence of
                attributes in novel images. We demonstrate a photo organization
                method based on predicted attributes. Finally we propose a
                high-level image editing method which allows a user to adjust
                the attributes of a scene, e.g. change a scene to be “snowy” or
                “sunset”. To support attribute manipulation we introduce a
                novel appearance transfer technique which is simple and fast
                yet competitive with the state-of-the-art. We show that we can
                convincingly modify many transient attributes in outdoor
                scenes.

                The trend towards increasingly deep neural networks has been
                driven by a general observation that increasing depth
                increases the performance of a network. Recently,
                however, evidence has been amassing that simply increasing
                depth may not be the best way to increase performance,
                particularly given other limitations. Investigations into deep
                residual networks have also suggested that they may not
                in fact be operating as a single deep network, but
                rather as an ensemble of many relatively shallow
                networks. We examine these issues, and in doing so
                arrive at a new interpretation of the unravelled view
                of deep residual networks which explains some of the
                behaviours that have been observed experimentally. As a
                result, we are able to derive a new, shallower,
                architecture of residual networks which significantly
                outperforms much deeper models such as ResNet-200 on
                the ImageNet classification dataset. We also show that
                this performance is transferable to other problem
                domains by developing a semantic segmentation approach
                which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a remarkable
                margin on datasets including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL
                Context, and Cityscapes. The architecture that we
                propose thus outperforms its comparators, including
                very deep ResNets, and yet is more efficient in memory
                use and sometimes also in training time. The code and

                We present variational generative adversarial networks, a
                general learning framework that combines a variational
                auto-encoder with a generative adversarial network, for
                synthesizing images of fine-grained categories, such as
                faces of a specific person or objects in a category.
                Our approach models an image as a composition of label
                and latent attributes in a probabilistic model. By
                varying the fine-grained category label fed to the
                resulting generative model, we can generate images in a
                specific category by randomly drawn values on a latent
                attribute vector. The novelty of our approach comes
                from two aspects. Firstly, we propose to adopt a cross
                entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier
                network, but a mean discrepancy objective for the
                generative network. This kind of asymmetric loss
                function makes the training of the GAN more stable.
                Secondly, we adopt an encoder network to learn the
                relationship between the latent space and the real
                image space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep
                the structure of generated images. We experiment with
                natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and
                demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of
                generating realistic and diverse samples with
                fine-grained category labels. We further show that our
                models can be applied to other tasks, such as image
                inpainting, super-resolution, and data augmentation for
                training better face recognition models.

                In this paper, we propose a novel generative model named
                Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN), which
                is trained to invert the hierarchical representations
                of a bottom-up discriminative network. Our model
                consists of a top-down stack of GANs, each learned to
                generate lower-level representations conditioned on
                higher-level representations. A representation
                discriminator is introduced at each feature hierarchy
                to encourage the representation manifold of the
                generator to align with that of the bottom-up
                discriminative network, leveraging the powerful
                discriminative representations to guide the generative
                model. In addition, we introduce a conditional loss
                that encourages the use of conditional information from
                the layer above, and a novel entropy loss that
                maximizes a variational lower bound on the conditional
                entropy of generator outputs. We first train each stack
                independently, and then train the whole model
                end-to-end. Unlike the original GAN that uses a single
                noise vector to represent all the variations, our SGAN
                decomposes variations into multiple levels and
                gradually resolves uncertainties in the top-down
                generative process. Based on visual inspection,
                Inception scores and visual Turing test, we demonstrate that
                SGAN is able to generate images of much higher quality
                than GANs without stacking.

  abstract = {
        The paucity of videos in current action classification datasets
        (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) has made it difficult to identify good
        video architectures, as most methods obtain similar performance
        on existing small-scale benchmarks. This paper re-evaluates
        state-of-the-art architectures in light of the new Kinetics
        Human Action Video dataset. Kinetics has two orders of
        magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400
        clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging
        YouTube videos. We provide an analysis on how current
        architectures fare on the task of action classification on this
        dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller
        benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics.

        We also introduce a new Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) that is
        based on 2D ConvNet inflation: filters and pooling kernels of very deep
        image classification ConvNets are expanded into 3D, making it possible
        to learn seamless spatio-temporal feature extractors from video while
        leveraging successful ImageNet architecture designs and even their
        parameters. We show that, after pre-training on Kinetics, I3D models
        considerably improve upon the state-of-the-art in action
        classification, reaching 80.7% on HMDB-51 and 98.0% on UCF-101.

        We propose a simple, yet effective approach for spatiotemporal feature learning
        using deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks (3D ConvNets) trained
        on a large scale supervised video dataset. Our findings are three-fold:
        1) 3D ConvNets are more suitable for spatiotemporal feature learning
        compared to 2D ConvNets; 2) A homogeneous architecture with small 3x3x3
        convolution kernels in all layers is among the best performing
        architectures for 3D ConvNets; and 3) Our learned features, namely C3D
        (Convolutional 3D), with a simple linear classifier outperform
        state-of-the-art methods on 4 different benchmarks and are comparable
        with current best methods on the other 2 benchmarks. In addition, the
        features are compact: achieving 52.8% accuracy on UCF101 dataset with
        only 10 dimensions and also very efficient to compute due to the fast
        inference of ConvNets. Finally, they are conceptually very simple and
        easy to train and use.

        Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively applied for

        propose and evaluate several deep neural network architectures to
        combine image information across a video over longer time periods than

        feature pooling architectures, examining the various design choices
        which need to be made when adapting a CNN for this task. The second

        frames. For this purpose we employ a recurrent neural network that uses
        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells which are connected to the output
        of the underlying CNN. Our best networks exhibit significant
        performance improvements over previously published results on the
        Sports 1 million dataset (73.1% vs. 60.9%) and the UCF-101 datasets

        Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video
        representation for action recognition and achieved state-of-the-art
        results on a variety of datasets. This paper improves their performance
        by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate
        camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF
        descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be
        complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a
        homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from
        camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the
        estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given
        the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it.
        We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the
        optical flow. This significantly improves motion-based descriptors,
        such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on four challenging action
        datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50)
        significantly outperform the current state of the art.

        Previous work on action recognition has focused on adapting
        hand-designed local features, such as SIFT or HOG, from static images
        to the video domain. In this paper, we propose using unsupervised
        feature learning as a way to learn features directly from video data.
        More specifically, we present an extension of the Independent Subspace
        Analysis algorithm to learn invariant spatio-temporal features from
        unlabeled video data. We discovered that, despite its simplicity, this
        method performs surprisingly well when combined with deep learning
        techniques such as stacking and convolution to learn hierarchical
        representations. By replacing hand-designed features with our learned
        features, we achieve classification results superior to all previous
        published results on the Hollywood2, UCF, KTH and YouTube action
        recognition datasets. On the challenging Hollywood2 and YouTube action
        datasets we obtain 53.3% and 75.8% respectively, which are
        approximately 5% better than the current best published results.
        Further benefits of this method, such as the ease of training and the
        efficiency of training and prediction, will also be discussed. You can

        Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions

        number of ways of fusing ConvNet towers both spatially and temporally

        make the following findings: (i) that rather than fusing at the softmax
        layer, a spatial and temporal network can be fused at a convolution
        layer without loss of performance, but with a substantial saving in
        parameters; (ii) that it is better to fuse such networks spatially at
        the last convolutional layer than earlier, and that additionally fusing
        at the class prediction layer can boost accuracy; finally (iii) that
        pooling of abstract convolutional features over spatiotemporal
        neighbourhoods further boosts performance. Based on these studies we
        propose a new ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal fusion of video

        Variational methods are among the most successful approaches to
        calculate the optical flow between two image frames. A particularly
        appealing formulation is based on total variation (TV) regularization
        and the robust L 1 norm in the data fidelity term. This formulation can
        preserve discontinuities in the flow field and offers an increased
        robustness against illumination changes, occlusions and noise. In this

title={Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning},
journal={Machine Learning},
year={1992},
month={May},
day={01},
volume={8},
number={3},
pages={229--256},
abstract={This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement
        learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic
        units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make
        weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of
        expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and
        certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this
        without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing
        information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific
        examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close
        relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but
        potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that
        show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with
        backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of
        additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including
        what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further
        considerations that might be used to help develop similar but
        potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},
