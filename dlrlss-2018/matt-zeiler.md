# Building a startup / scaling and deploying ML systems

- Next step: cloud to edge devices. Mobile SDK.

- Winning ImageNet: classification task not a business usecase.

- Datadog: system utilization tool. Free version: graphene.

- Scaling up services: front-end API -> load balancer -> internal Go API ->
  logging / compute / database.

- Continuous integration. Testing and deployment. Merge -> test -> code review
  -> deploy (dev) -> monitor for errors -> promote to staging.

- "Holy grail of AI": algo + data in provided platform for custom training.

- Mentor vs. coach (therapist)

- Rules of thumb:

        - Write things down

        - Learn

        - Iterate

        - Automate


## Questions

- Issue tracking?

- Schedule?

- Ops rotation: all engineers, certain level?
