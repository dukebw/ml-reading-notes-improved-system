# Deep learning


## Designing new architectures

- Structured prediction by unrolling probabilistic inference in an MRF.

- Tamar et al., NIPS 2016 (planning by unrolling value iteration algorithm).

- Few shot learning by unrolling gradient descent on small training set.
  (Ravi and Larochelle, ICLR 2017).


# "Unintuitive" properties of neural nets

- Identifying and attacked the saddle point problem in high dimensional
  nonconvex optimization (Dauphin et al., NIPS 2014).

        - A random function's stationary points are mostly saddle points.

        - The optimization process "puts pressure" on the function

- Qualitatively characterizing neural network optimization problems.
  (Goodfellow et al., ICLR 2015).

- Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization.
  (Zhang et al., ICLR 2017).

- Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural nets.
  (Kirkpatrick et al., PNAS 2017).
